SVM_using_character_ngrams.ipynb contains the code to execute the final implementation of SVM approach. The code should be able to be ran just by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and executing each block of code.

SVM_using_character_ngrams_iterator.ipynb contains the code that was used to perform the input parameter and hyper parameter trade studies. The code should be able to be ran just by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and executing each block of code. WARNING: This code executed extremely slowly on my conputer with a i7-10750 processor and 16 GB of RAM. It will likely take hours to run to completion.

Initial Data Exploration.ipynb contains the code to execute the implementation of K-means with word embeddings. The code should be able to be ran just by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and executing each block of code.

Authorship_group_project.ipynb contains the code to execute the implementation of K-means with character n-grams. The code should be able to be ran just by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and executing each block of code.

For additional code exploration, cmiller_preprocessing branch is the branch Curtis Miller worked in to develop the SVM appraoch, smau-preprocessing is the branch Stephen Mau worked in to develop the K-means with word embedding approach, and pshirts_preprocessing is the branch Stephen Mau worked in to develop the K-means with character n-grams approach.
